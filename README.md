# Design change on Udacity's website: Testing if a new feature improves user experience and elevates retention

## Background
- Udacity is an educational organization offering massive open online courses.
- It has invested heavily in the course content, leaving the design team with sparse resources for quantitative data-driven decisions.
 - The design team wants to introduce an add-on functionality on their subscription page, and they want to determine if the decision can be supported by quantitative studies
 - The new feature displays a precaution message to users who enrol for the free trial option- this will only be displayed to users who do not meet the criteria of allocating five hours per week

## Problem Objective
The design team wants to assess if a proposed new feature improves user experience and elevates retention. This will be measured through the maximization of two metrics - course completion and retention of students post free trial period.
